#Twitter Contest Retweet Bot in Ruby

## Update 1-16-20

- Will be working on the javascript version trying to get that to work

**Email me** _<rudyonrails86@gmail.com>_

## Still working on script

### Info:

This is based off the **Python** script written by [Hunter Scott - "Twitter Contest Winning as a service"]("http://www.hscott.net/twitter-contest-winning-as-a-service/) but written in **Ruby** and works with current **Twitter** detection.

###Future Plans:

1. Maybe available through a web page
2. Return list of contests and info and select which you want to enter. Or just win it all!

### How to Use:

1.  Enter Twitter OATH info and login to twitter with bot
2.  Enter in terms to search for Search like "retweet to win!" "RT to win".
3.  Retweets all results including the search keyword.
