#Twitter Contest Retweet Bot in Ruby

__Email me__ *<rudyonrails86@gmail.com>* 


### Info:
This is based off the **Python** script written by   [Hunter Scott - "Twitter Contest Winning as a service"]("http://www.hscott.net/twitter-contest-winning-as-a-service/) but written in **Ruby** and works with current **Twitter** detection.

###Future Plans:
1. GUI ?? would anyone want that?
2. Maybe available through a web page
3. Return list of contests and info and select which you want to enter. Or just win it all!
4. YOu tell me??

### How to Use:
1.  Enter Twitter OATH info and login to twitter with bot
2.  Enter in terms to search for Search like "retweet to win!" "RT to win". 
3.  Retweets all results including the search keyword.
